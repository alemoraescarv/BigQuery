### BigQuery Repository

This repository stores: SQL, Python, Shell, Spark and JavaScript(inside the SQL folder) directories. Each one of them contains code I created to perform various Data Analysis tasks. Even though, I used them in BigQuery in Google Cloud Platform, you can also find some useful code for you to use in another platform.
